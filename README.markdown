TSR: Tiny Speech Recognizer
===========================

**TSR** is a light weight speech recognizer written in C.
It has the following major goals, in decreasing importance:

* Be small: tiny source, tiny binary.
* Be fast: RTF (*real time factor*) below 0.5 on any modern system.
* Be portable: Don't use any fancy libraries.
